    - `distributed-ai-development`
    - `infrastructure-automation`
  - [ ] Add realistic issues with `bzzz-task` labels
  - [ ] Configure repository access tokens
  - [ ] Test GitHub API compatibility

### 4. Real Coordination Scenarios
- [ ] **Cross-Repository Dependency Testing**
  - [ ] Create realistic dependency scenarios between repositories
  - [ ] Test antennae framework with actual dependency conflicts
  - [ ] Verify coordination session creation and resolution

- [ ] **Multi-Agent Task Coordination**
  - [ ] Test scenarios with multiple agents working on related tasks
  - [ ] Verify conflict detection and resolution
  - [ ] Test consensus mechanisms

### 5. Infrastructure Improvements
